# Bryptor-Simple-Discord-Raider
Very Simple
## A simple discord raider that allows users to spam messages in a server.

## About

A script that I made that can raid discord servers. This script
allows you to spam a text channel with any message 

This works on Mac and Windows.



## How to use
### Get Python
If you dont have python installed, download python 3.7.6
and make sure you click on the 'ADD TO PATH' option during
the installation.

### paste your tokens

a Discord token is unique identifier. It can be useful for things like bots to use your account outside of the Discord client itself.
It allows the script to send messages in your discord account.

Put your discord account tokens in the tokens.txt
file. 

### pip install these
Open up cmd 
```
pip install colorama
pip install -U discord.py
pip install requests
```

### to run the script..
```
python raider.py
```
Make sure you are in the same directory.
### To make all accounts leave the server..
```
python massleave.py
```
To get the server id, right click on the server name (Top left) and click copy id.

###Tokens.txt
put your token in this file.
